TODO list
Features
- Fix raytracing to become more consistent.
- I want to have different types of blocks that i can place
- I want to have an inventory
- Spread water function is not working atm, make it happen
- Activate the water and make the raytracing penetrate water, maybe add opacity property to each block to work with this?

Bugs
- The reach that I use to select and remove blocks is really buggy

Working on:
