TODO list
Features
- Fix raytracing to become more consistent.
- I want to have different types of blocks that i can place
- I want to have an inventory
- Spread water function is not working atm, make it happen
- Fix so that spread water works in game engine aswell so that it becomes more dynamic.
- Activate the water and make the raytracing penetrate water, maybe add opacity property to each block to work with this?
- Only allow placing of blocks in unoccupied space
- Only render entities that is hit with light ray
- Make rays scatter when they hit a corner, so that lighting becomes more natural

Bugs
- The reach that I use to select and remove blocks is really buggy, I thinkt he stepsize is to big. The problem might be that stepsize is the wrong approach.

Working on:

Completed:
- Should only be able to place blocks close to me and adjecent to another block.
- Add aim line, to help user.
- Sun should be regarded as a lightsource, not my head
